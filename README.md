 Simple simulation of Darwinism and evolution in monkeys with C#. Created in Unity, developed all art assets with Piskel. Genetic evolution algorithm using uniform crossover and random resetting mutation.
 
 Monkey Basics
  Monkeys need energy in order to survive, but each monkey's energy depletes over time. To keep their energy from depleting to zero, monkeys have to eat bananas. Monkeys have several genes that contribute to a monkey's ability to find and eat bananas. Once a monkey's energy has reached a certian point, they are able to breed with another monkey. When two monkeys breed, another monkey spawns that has some of the genetic makeup of its two parents. The genes are inherited using uniform crossover and random resetting mutation; meaning, each parent has a 50 percent chance of passing on each gene to the child. There is a 27 percent chance that a monkey will undergo a mutation, where a random gene is picked and is reset to a random value.
